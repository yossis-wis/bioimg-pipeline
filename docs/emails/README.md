# Email drafts

This folder contains copy/paste-ready drafts for vendor communication.

- `cni_modular_laser_inquiry_email.md`: modular laser inquiry email (Approach A vs B)
- `assets/`: diagrams referenced by the email draft

## Regenerating the diagrams

The diagrams are generated by:

- `notebooks/08_cni_laser_system_diagrams.py`
- driven by `configs/cni_laser_inquiry.yaml`

The notebook can export PNGs (toggle `EXPORT = True`) and writes them under `reports/` (gitignored).
If you regenerate, copy the PNGs you want to track into `docs/emails/assets/` and keep filenames stable.
