# Email drafts

This folder contains copy/paste-ready drafts for vendor communication.

- `cni_modular_laser_inquiry_email.md`: modular laser inquiry email (Approach A vs B)
- `assets/`: **local-only** diagram images referenced by the draft (intentionally **gitignored**)

## Notes on diagrams / assets

This repo is currently kept **text-only** (no tracked binaries).

- You may keep PNGs under `docs/emails/assets/` for local use / attaching to emails, but they should **not** be committed.
- `docs/emails/assets/.gitignore` keeps the directory present while ignoring diagram binaries.

## Regenerating diagrams (optional)

Diagrams can be generated by:

- `notebooks/08_cni_laser_system_diagrams.py`
- driven by `configs/cni_laser_inquiry.yaml`

The notebook can export PNGs (toggle `EXPORT = True`) and writes them under `reports/` (gitignored).
Copy any PNGs you want to attach into `docs/emails/assets/` (still gitignored) and keep filenames stable if you want the markdown links to render locally.
