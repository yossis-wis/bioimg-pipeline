# Email drafts

This folder contains copy/paste-ready drafts for vendor communication.

- `cni_modular_laser_inquiry_email.md`: modular laser inquiry email (Approach A vs B)
- `cni_quote_summary_2026-02-05.md`: text-only summary of the quote reply received on 2026-02-05 (for design notes)
- `wide_linewidth_mmf_multi_vendor_inquiry_email.md`: short multi-vendor inquiry email for the “wide-linewidth + square step-index MMF” speckle-reduction approach
- `wide_linewidth_mmf_multi_vendor_supporting_note.md`: optional 1–2 page technical note to attach (background, figures to cite, exact questions)

## Notes on diagrams / assets

This repo is kept **text-only** (no tracked binaries).

- **SVG diagrams are tracked** under `docs/figures/` and can be embedded directly in these markdown emails.
- You may keep **local-only** PNGs under `docs/emails/assets/` for attaching to emails, but they should **not** be committed.
- `docs/emails/assets/.gitignore` keeps the directory present while ignoring diagram binaries.

## Regenerating / exporting diagrams (optional)

- Diagrams can be generated by:
  - `notebooks/08_cni_laser_system_diagrams.py`
  - driven by `configs/cni_laser_inquiry.yaml`
- If you need a PNG for emailing, export from the tracked SVGs (e.g. via Inkscape) or toggle `EXPORT = True` in the notebook and copy the resulting PNGs into `docs/emails/assets/` (still gitignored).


### If you accidentally committed a binary (PNG/PDF/etc)

`gitignore` prevents *new* binaries from being added, but it does **not** remove files that are already tracked.

To untrack a mistakenly-committed asset while keeping your local copy:

```bash
git rm --cached docs/emails/assets/<file.png>
# (repeat for each file)
git commit -m "Stop tracking email asset binaries"
```

If you want to also remove the file from your working tree, omit `--cached`.

To catch this early, run:

```bash
python scripts/check_repo_bloat.py
```
